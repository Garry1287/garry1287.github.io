Occasionally I have to analyze tcp-streams, and occasionally I came to a point where i had to extract files out of huge dumps. What I found during my last research about a year ago was not really usable - i hacked together a few lines of perl to extract exactly what i wanted - this didn't deliver exact files, but was enough to help me solve a problem.

Jim Clausing, one of the more practical guys over at ISC described the same problem recently and asked the readers of the ISC-Blog for software that is able to extract files from pcap-dump. People came out with a load of promising solutions:

* NetworkMiner [http://networkminer.sourceforge.ne/](http://networkminer.sourceforge.ne/)
* tcpxtract [http://tcpxtract.sourceforge.net/)](http://tcpxtract.sourceforge.net/))
* bro [http://www.bro-ids.org/](http://www.bro-ids.org/)
* tcpflow [http://www.circlemud.org/~jelson/software/tcpflow/](http://www.circlemud.org/~jelson/software/tcpflow/)
* foremost [http://foremost.sourceforge.net/](http://foremost.sourceforge.net/)
* dsniff [http://www.monkey.org/~dugsong/dsniff/](http://www.monkey.org/~dugsong/dsniff/)
* Chaosreader [http://chaosreader.sourceforge.net/](http://chaosreader.sourceforge.net/)
* pyflag [http://www.pyflag.net/cgi-bin/moin.cgi](http://www.pyflag.net/cgi-bin/moin.cgi)
* tcptrace [http://www.tcptrace.org/](http://www.tcptrace.org/)
* tcpick [http://tcpick.sourceforge.net/](http://tcpick.sourceforge.net/)
* xtract.py [http://www.malforge.com/npeid/xtract.py](http://www.malforge.com/npeid/xtract.py)

Not all of them might do exactly what you want - but this is defintely the best overview on pcap-file-extractors I ever came across.
