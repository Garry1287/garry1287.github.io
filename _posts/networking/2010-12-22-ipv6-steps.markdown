BGP Dual Stack IPv4 IPV6 Configuration Guide.

I recently worked in this configuration and works pretty nice.

 

Router A

interface GigabitEthernet1
 ip address 192.168.64.215 255.255.255.0
 ipv6 address 2001:AAAA:BBBB:CCCC::1/64

router bgp XXXX
 bgp router-id 1.1.1.1
 bgp log-neighbor-changes
 no bgp default ipv4-unicast
 neighbor 2001:AAAA:BBBB:CCCC::2 remote-as 2
 neighbor 192.168.64.214 remote-as 2
 !
 address-family ipv4
  redistribute connected
  neighbor 192.168.64.214 activate
 exit-address-family
 !
 address-family ipv6
  redistribute connected
  neighbor 2001:AAAA:BBBB:CCCC::2 activate
 exit-address-family

 

 

Router B

 

interface GigabitEthernet1
 ip address 192.168.64.215 255.255.255.0
 negotiation auto
 ipv6 address 2001:AAAA:BBBB:CCCC::1/64

 


router bgp 2
 bgp router-id 2.2.2.2
 bgp log-neighbor-changes
 no bgp default ipv4-unicast
 neighbor 2001:AAAA:BBBB:CCCC::1 remote-as 1
 neighbor 192.168.64.215 remote-as 1
 !

Which of the following statements refer to 6RD?

There are two correct answers. Please choose both of them to get the full score for this question.
Select one or more:

Does not require signalling to know that the transition mechanism is available

Requires a signalling to let the device know that the transition mechanism is available

Encapsulates IPv6 inside an IPv4 packet
Correct! 6RD is a tunnelling mechanism that encapsulates IPv6 inside IPv4.

Encapsulates IPv4 in IPv6

The "Destination Options” are only to be processed by the destination of the packet.
The "Destination Options” are only to be processed by the destination of the packet.
Select one:
True
False
Feedback

"Destination Options" may appear twice in the Extension Headers and they should only be processed by the destination of the IPv6 packet. All the devices in the middle should ignore these options.




When a message is sent to a Solicited Node address, it will be processed ONLY by the hosts that joined that multicast group.

Which is the IPv6 Transition Mechanism that is very easy to roll out for a large customer base (for example, ADSL, home users); Latency is low and customer experience is good because the whole tunnelling mechanism is within the provider's network?


Please write down the name of the IPv6 Transition Mechanism.
