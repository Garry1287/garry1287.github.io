[http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/7200/install_and_upgrade/network_process_engine_install_config/npense/4448o6.html#wpxref30477](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/7200/install_and_upgrade/network_process_engine_install_config/npense/4448o6.html#wpxref30477)

The NPE-G2 has its own Cisco IOS software image with the prefix "c7200p-" in the software images filenames, including the boot image. The NPE-G2 does not boot up with a software image with the prefix "c7200-". Previous network processing engines, or the network services engine, do not boot up with the "c7200p-" boot image. They use the prefix "c7200-".

The Cisco 7201 router extends the Cisco 7200 Series innovation leadership with a new 1RU compact form factor router offering not only high-performance through the integrated fixed Network Processing Engine (NPE-G2) but also a low power consumption routing solution.
